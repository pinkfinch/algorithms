# One of the most classical problems that can be solved with the backtracking algorithm is the N-Queen puzzle.
# The N-queens puzzle is the problem of placing N queens on an [NÃ—N] chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
# One is asked to count the number of solutions to place the N queens on the board.
# As a reminder, a queen can attack any piece that is situated at the same row, column or diagonal of the queue.
# As shown in the board below, if we place a queen at the row 1 and column 1 of the board, we then cross out all
# the cells that could be attacked by this queen.
